//An application made after experimenting with the shader examples from the book:
* Mastering openFrameworks: Creative Coding Demystified *

//Running
- Set yourself up with xCode and openFrameworks
- git clone this repo to openFrameworks/apps/myApps/
- Run shaderCamPerlinNoise.xcodeproj
- See your face warping to the rhythm of Classic Perlin Noise.

Still to add:
- A GUI for each layer of noise
- 3d - Possibly
- Audio Re-actable stuff
